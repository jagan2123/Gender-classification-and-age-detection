Better Weather Model

# Better Weather Model

**Better Weather Model** is an AI-driven system that classifies the nearest city according to its comfort score, based on weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and air quality. The goal is to provide users with the most comfortable city based on their preferences.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify the "comfort score" of different cities based on various environmental parameters. The model helps in identifying the nearest city that provides the best weather conditions tailored to the user's preferences.

### Features
- **Weather Classification**: Classifies cities based on comfort levels (e.g., comfortable temperature, humidity, air quality).
- **Nearest City Classification**: Recommends the nearest city with the best comfort score.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Integrates weather APIs to fetch live data for classification.
- **User Preferences**: Allows users to input their ideal temperature and other preferences to get personalized recommendations.
